1. Constructor Basics

What is a Constructor?
    A constructor is a special function in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize objects.

Rules:
    It has same name as the class.
    It has no return type (not even void).
    Can be default, parameterized, or copy constructor.

A. Default Constructor
    Initializes data members with default or fixed values.

Example:
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Student {
    public:
        Student() {
            cout << "Default Constructor Called!" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Student s1;  // Constructor automatically called
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Default Constructor Called!

B. Parameterized Constructor
    Takes arguments to initialize values during object creation.

Example:
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Student {
    public:
        string name;
        int age;

        Student(string n, int a) {
            name = n;
            age = a;
        }

        void display() {
            cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Student s1("Ravi", 20);
        s1.display();
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Name: Ravi, Age: 20

C. Copy Constructor
    Creates a new object by copying values from an existing object.

Example:
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Student {
    public:
        string name;
        int age;

        Student(string n, int a) {
            name = n;
            age = a;
        }

        // Copy Constructor
        Student(const Student &s) {
            name = s.name;
            age = s.age;
        }

        void display() {
            cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Student s1("Amit", 22);
        Student s2 = s1;  // Calls copy constructor
        s2.display();
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Name: Amit, Age: 22

Why Constructor Cannot Be Static?
    A static function belongs to the class, not to an object.
    But constructor is called automatically when an object is created.
    So, if a constructor were static, it wouldn’t be able to initialize non-static members, which defeats its purpose.

Why Constructor Has No Return Type?
    It does not return any value, not even void.
    Its job is to initialize, not to return data.
    Returning a value from a constructor would conflict with the object creation mechanism of C++.

2. Destructor Basics
    
What is a Destructor?
    Destructor is used to clean up resources when an object goes out of scope.
    Syntax: ~ClassName()
    Called automatically at the end of the program or when an object is deleted.

Example:
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Student {
    public:
        Student() {
            cout << "Constructor Called!" << endl;
        }

        ~Student() {
            cout << "Destructor Called!" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Student s1;
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Constructor Called!
    Destructor Called!

3. Constructor Overloading
    You can define multiple constructors with different parameters.

Example:
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Rectangle {
        int length, breadth;

    public:
        Rectangle() {  // Default
            length = 0;
            breadth = 0;
        }

        Rectangle(int l) {  // One parameter
            length = l;
            breadth = l;
        }

        Rectangle(int l, int b) {  // Two parameters
            length = l;
            breadth = b;
        }

        void area() {
            cout << "Area: " << length * breadth << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Rectangle r1;
        Rectangle r2(5);
        Rectangle r3(4, 6);

        r1.area();  // 0
        r2.area();  // 25
        r3.area();  // 24
        return 0;
    }

Output:
    Area: 0
    Area: 25
    Area: 24

Summary:

| Concept                 | Purpose                           | Automatically Called? | Customizable? |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Default Constructor     | Initializes with default values   | Yes                   | Yes           |
| Parameterized           | Initializes with given arguments  | Yes                   | Yes           |
| Copy Constructor        | Creates a copy of existing object | Yes (in some cases)   | Yes           |
| Destructor              | Frees memory/resources            | Yes                   | Yes           |

4. Importance of Destructors in Memory Management
    In C++, a destructor is a special member function that is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It plays a crucial role in freeing up resources and ensuring efficient memory management.

Why Destructors Are Important:
1. Automatic Cleanup
    Destructors are called automatically when:
        An object goes out of scope (e.g., end of a function)
        delete is used on a dynamically allocated object
    This ensures that allocated memory and resources are released, even if the programmer forgets.

2. Prevent Memory Leaks
    If an object dynamically allocates memory (e.g., using new), that memory must be freed using delete.
    A destructor ensures that cleanup happens even if the program exits unexpectedly or the object goes out of scope.

When Destructors Are Most Useful:

| Situation                    | Destructor Use                           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic memory (`new`)       | Free memory using `delete` or `delete[]` |
| File handling                | Close file pointers                      |
| Database/network connections | Release connections                      |
| Logging/debugging            | Track when an object is destroyed        |
| Resource-bound classes       | Handle deallocation cleanly              |

What Happens If You Don’t Use a Destructor?
    Memory Leaks: Memory is allocated but never freed.
    File Descriptors Leak: Files or sockets remain open.
    Resource Exhaustion: The system runs out of memory or handles over time.
    Unstable Programs: Behavior becomes unpredictable, especially in long-running applications.

Real-life Example:
    Constructor: You book a hotel room and get the key.
    Destructor: You check out, return the key, and room is cleaned for the next guest.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Cleanup resources and memory used by the object               |
| Called Automatically | Yes, when object is destroyed                                 |
| Defined With         | `~ClassName()`                                                |
| Custom Code          | Yes, especially when dynamic allocation or file/resource used |
